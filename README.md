# Trackball-Hammerspoon
Scroll wheel and button remapping code for trackballs!

Based on code by Owenlo (https://github.com/owenlo/Marble-Hammerspoon)
Based on code originally by Burdu (https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/issues/814#issuecomment-415388742). 

The best kind of open source :)

I've added  trackball bindings for the Elecom Deft Pro so you don't need the drivers.

The Deft Pro features include:

1. Hold-to-scroll with the trackball
2. Scroll wheel tilt left/right to change virtual workspaces
3. One-button copy-paste
3. Doesn't modify built-in trackpad behavior
